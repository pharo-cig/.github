# Pharo Interface Garden
A place where all C bindings for pharo can hang around, along with its creator, [pharo-cig](https://github.com/pharo-cig/pharo-cig).

## Warning! Install requirements 
We use the last version of UnifiedFFI (that we evolve even while making pharo-cig work).   
If you are using one of the citizens of the garden in a version older than Pharo 14, is highly probably 
you need to first install the compatible version of [UnifiedFFI](https://github.com/pharo-cig/UnifiedFFI)

Check [UnifiedFFI Install Instuctions](https://github.com/pharo-cig/UnifiedFFI/blob/main/README.md).
